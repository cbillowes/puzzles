  "Imagine you work for a newspaper and you're job is to automatically post
   news articles to Twitter. Of course, you need hash tags. Write a function
   that takes the headline (as a string) and returns a list of hashtags.
   The hashtags should be the three longest words in the headline, ordered
   longest to shortest, and of course, with a # in front. If there are fewer
   than three words, use as many words as there are. If two words are of the
   same length, prefer the one that occurs closest to the beginning."
